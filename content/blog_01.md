      - title: What is the Lean Startup?
        description: >
          "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continous Innovation
          to Create Radically Successful Businesses" by Eric Ries describes the
          core strategies for starting a business and has offered Büt Camp, Inc.
          a variety of inspirations and angles to consider. In this blog post,
          we especially want to discuss Leap of Faith Assumptions, including
          growth and value hypothesis, pivot and persevere points, and metrics
          and feedback loop with our valued customers.

          ## **Value Hypothesis**&#xA;<br /><br />



          We operate under the assumption that there is a value and a need for
          Büt Camp products in today's society. Disaster and emergency response
          needs to be quick, efficient, and easily distributed. People working
          in these fields or individually preparing for disaster require tools
          and products that anyone can function in a stressful situation. There
          is already a market for products to prepare for emergency response,
          and people would want additional product options for emergency
          shelters to diversify their preparedness plan. <br /><br />

          Additionally, Büt Camp is designed to be environmentally friendly and
          can be discarded in an emergency without environmental consequences.
          People are moving towards eco-friendly options to replace traditional
          products that are not biodegradable and will want a product that
          minimizes their waste.<br /><br />


          ## **Growth Hypothesis**<br /><br />


          Büt Camp Inc. is starting small with a limited staff. Once we have
          developed our local customer base, local brick-and-mortar businesses
          will purchase and stock them in their stores. Once we have developed
          our online customer base, our brand will be more recognized on a
          broader level. With brand recognition and wider distribution, we will
          gain the attention of larger groups at regional, state, and federal
          levels in need of additional emergency shelter options.
      - title: Metrics for Success
        description: >
          Büt Camp Inc. takes a multi-pronged approach to measuring customer
          response. Indirectly, we use web analytics to track the number of
          visits to the site, number of clicks, time spent on the site, referral
          links, incomplete purchases (added to cart but did not complete), and
          complete purchases.




          Feedback options are available on our website, ranging from a
          one-click product rating feedback to providing written reviews and
          comments. More directly, we will conduct a limited number of
          one-on-one interviews with users for a qualitative analysis of
          responses to the product.
