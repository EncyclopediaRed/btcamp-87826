      - title: What is the Lean Startup?
        description: >
          "The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continous Innovation
          to Create Radically Successful Businesses" by Eric Ries describes the
          core strategies for starting a business and has offered Büt Camp, Inc.
          a variety of inspirations and angles to consider. In this blog post,
          we especially want to discuss Leap of Faith Assumptions, including
          growth and value hypothesis, pivot and persevere points, and metrics
          and feedback loop with our valued customers.

      - title: Leap of Faith Assumptions

          ## **Value Hypothesis**&#xA;<br /><br />



          We operate under the assumption that there is a value and a need for
          Büt Camp products in today's society. Disaster and emergency response
          needs to be quick, efficient, and easily distributed. People working
          in these fields or individually preparing for disaster require tools
          and products that anyone can function in a stressful situation. There
          is already a market for products to prepare for emergency response,
          and people would want additional product options for emergency
          shelters to diversify their preparedness plan. <br /><br />

          Additionally, Büt Camp is designed to be environmentally friendly and
          can be discarded in an emergency without environmental consequences.
          People are moving towards eco-friendly options to replace traditional
          products that are not biodegradable and will want a product that
          minimizes their waste.<br /><br />


          ## **Growth Hypothesis**<br /><br />


          Büt Camp Inc. is starting small with a limited staff. Once we have
          developed our local customer base, local brick-and-mortar businesses
          will purchase and stock them in their stores. Once we have developed
          our online customer base, our brand will be more recognized on a
          broader level. With brand recognition and wider distribution, we will
          gain the attention of larger groups at regional, state, and federal
          levels in need of additional emergency shelter options.
      - title: Metrics for Success
        description: >
          Büt Camp Inc. takes a multi-pronged approach to measuring customer
          response. Indirectly, we use web analytics to track the number of
          visits to the site, number of clicks, time spent on the site, referral
          links, incomplete purchases (added to cart but did not complete), and
          complete purchases.




          Feedback options are available on our website, ranging from a
          one-click product rating feedback to providing written reviews and
          comments. More directly, we will conduct a limited number of
          one-on-one interviews with users for a qualitative analysis of
          responses to the product.
      - title: Pivot & Persevere Actions
        description: >
          We want to know when we need to make a design update to our products.
          We monitor feedback quarterly and if any of the following actions
          occurs, we pivot or persevere as needed to bring the best possible
          product. 


          1.  If <25% of customers report that the product is dysfunctional, we
          persevere and work with our manufacturer and suppliers to improve
          quality control measures.


          2.  If <50% of customers report that the product is dysfunctional, we
          pivot and reevaluate with our manufacturer and develop a new design.
          This includes structural issues, setup workflow, and color.


          3.  If <50% of customers report that individual units are too
          expensive, we persevere and market the bulk sales price, which is
          significantly reduced.


          4.  If <75% of customers report that individual units are too
          expensive, we pivot and reevaluate the prices of individual versus
          bulk products and increase the price of the bulk items to decrease the
          cost of an individual unit.
