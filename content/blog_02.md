          **Modern Data Governance Needs**


          Have you ever wondered what really happens with the data you provide
          your online services and accounts? Of course you have! Using Google,
          Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and any other e-commerce or social media
          service not only allows them to keep your data, but use it to generate
          product recommendations and targeted ads.




          The individual user has little autonomy over what happens to their
          data they knowingly or unknowingly provide online services and
          websites. There are specific laws for protecting User Data, but in the
          US they are only just being introduced in Congress (for example, see
          H.R.4240 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): User Data Protection Act.
          (2021, June 29).
          <https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4240).>




          General Data Protection Regulation¹ do exist, as well as the Personal
          Data Protection Bill, however, current data rights are often exchanged
          from the company and its consumers through Privacy Policies, User
          Agreements, and/or Terms of Condition, which are challenging and
          lengthy to read and difficult to combat if they are read and
          disagreeable to the user. Teresa Scassa, the Canada Research Chair in
          Information Law and Policy at the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of
          Law, sums it up perfectly: “There is simply too much to manage, and
          often the way it is presented to consumers makes it difficult for them
          to make informed choices. In this context, clicking “I agree” without
          reading privacy policies is an act of surrender, not of consent.”³




          We hear you, Teresa.


          Recently there have been calls for companies to answer for how they
          manage user data and what they use it for, an example being the recent
          2020 inquiry into multiple e-commerce and social media companies
          including Amazon, TikTok, Twitter, and others,⁴ as well as multiple
          discussions on ethical data use in many other applications,⁴ including
          other tech companies like Uber, Google Maps, and Facebook⁵


          We believe that businesses should have clear, transparent standards on
          how they will use customer data that is human-readable.

          Büt Camp Inc. wants a solution that allows our customer data to
          benefit the company, researchers, and other companies through ethical
          data sharing.
