          **Modern Data Governance Needs**<br /><br />


          Have you ever wondered what really happens with the data you provide
          your online services and accounts? Of course you have! Using Google,
          Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and any other e-commerce or social media
          service not only allows them to keep your data, but use it to generate
          product recommendations and targeted ads.<br /><br />


          The individual user has little autonomy over what happens to their
          data they knowingly or unknowingly provide online services and
          websites. There are specific laws for protecting User Data, but in the
          US they are only just being introduced in Congress (for example, see
          H.R.4240 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): User Data Protection Act.
          (2021, June 29).
          (<https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4240).>

          General Data Protection Regulation (<https://gdpr-info.eu/>) do exist,
          as well as the Personal Data Protection Bill, however, current data
          rights are often exchanged from the company and its consumers through
          Privacy Policies, User Agreements, and/or Terms of Condition, which
          are challenging and lengthy to read and difficult to combat if they
          are read and disagreeable to the user. Teresa Scassa, the Canada
          Research Chair in Information Law and Policy at the University of
          Ottawa’s Faculty of Law, sums it up perfectly: “There is simply too
          much to manage, and often the way it is presented to consumers makes
          it difficult for them to make informed choices. In this context,
          clicking “I agree” without reading privacy policies is an act of
          surrender, not of consent” (Scassa 2018).<br /><br />


          We hear you, Teresa.<br /><br />


          Recently there have been calls for companies to answer for how they
          manage user data and what they use it for, an example being the recent
          2020 inquiry into multiple e-commerce and social media companies
          including Amazon, TikTok, Twitter, and others (Diaz 2020), as well as
          multiple discussions on ethical data use in many other applications,
          including other tech companies like Uber, Google Maps, and Facebook
          (Janiszewska-Kiewra, Podlesny, & Soller 2020).<br /><br />


          We believe that businesses should have clear, transparent standards on
          how they will use customer data that is human-readable. Büt Camp Inc.
          wants a solution that allows our customer data to benefit the company,
          researchers, and other companies through ethical data sharing.
      - title: 'The Solution: Data Trusts'
        description: >
          **A Data Trust is a legal framework for managing data (Qlarion).**<br
          /><br />


          What that really means is that there is a group of beneficiaries that
          produce data who enter a legal contract based on trust law with
          trustees who follow the contract and facilitate the appropriate
          handling of the data. This means that beneficiaries have complete
          control and understanding of how their data is being used and why.<br
          /><br />


          There are 3 primary concepts involved in a data trust (Ada Lovelace
          Institute and AI Council 2021):


          1.  There is a clear intention to establish a trust duck duck duck

          2.  The subject matter or property of the Trust is defined

          3.  The beneficiaries of the Trust are specified (including as a
          conceptual category rather than nominally)


          Data Trusts are used in several fields, including social media,
          hospitals and other health data repositories, research data,
          artificial intelligence research and data, and, you guessed it,
          e-commerce.<br /><br />


          Key Entities for data trusts include the following:


          *   **Beneficiaries**: Data producers (customers, individuals,
              companies, organizations, society)

          *   **Trustees**: Those entrusted with monitoring compliance and
              gatekeeping of data based on agreed-upon terms with the beneficiaries

          *   **Trust Law**: “Trust law refers to laws governing the creation
              and implementation of trusts, which are fiduciary relationships. In this type of relationship, one party (called the trustor) gives a second party (called the trustee) the right to hold title to assets or property for the benefit of a third party (called the beneficiary).”

          *   **Data Rights**: The right for individuals to know what is
              happening with their data without having to read intentionally confusing and lengthy agreements

          *   **Technology**: Validation, storage, and security measures applied
              to data with access limited to the Trustees

          *   **Funding Models**: Ranging from funded, unfunded, endowment,
              subscription, etc.

          *   **Shared Data Goals**: Understanding of and agreement of
              beneficiaries on how data is shared, to whom it is shared, why it is shared, and compliance with these parameters<br /><br />

          Below is a lifecycle for how a data trust works with Büt Camp, Inc.
          built into the model. Essentially, we provide a clear, concise
          statement to all users describing their data rights before they enter
          any personal information. We keep only the data necessary to complete
          an order successfully, and data is put into a data trust that Büt Camp
          uses for ethical research.

      - title: Benefits & Risks of Data Trusts
        description: "**Benefits**\n\n*   Ethical use of customer data through law and policy that protect data rights and use, rather than selling it to other companies(1)\n\n*   Trust becomes a major marketing opportunity tool as a plus to buying from the company\n\n*   No difficult, lengthy contract agreements\n\n*   Shared understanding of what data is used for\n\n*   Large repository of user data to pull from for market analysis and lead generation that may include additional companies’ data that they have also put into the same Data Trust\n\n*   Supports data rights, rather than the data itself as an intangible object, which does not restrict the type of data but rather how it is used¹\n\n*   Flexibility and data storage and data access2\n\n*   Multiple Data Trusts means multiple options to choose from that can fit the needs of the Beneficiaries (customers of e-commerce) and data users (Büt Camp Inc.) alike\n\n*   Funding models vary so Data Trusts can be chosen based on a preferred funding source or structure\n\n*   Supports risk mitigation for data storage and vulnerability\n\n*   Supports responsible data sharing to increase and improve valid research\n\n*   Misuse of data, while possible, can be mitigated by the data stewards authorizing the access once trust is broken\n\n<br /><br />**Risks**\n\n*   Lower targeting marketing opportunities\n\n    *   “The same piece of data, depending on a particular context, can be personal and non-personal, more or less likely to relate to an identifiable natural person, and with a stronger or weaker link to that person. \\[…] The difficulty lies, first, in determining at which point the level of relation to an individual is sufficient to establish property rights, and second, in tracing the presence of such a relation.” (3)\n\n*   Even data from Trusts can be examined to mine potentially specific health and well-being data\n\n*   Like social media data, there is a high potential for loyalty card data to be used, particularly from supermarkets, in the context of personalized health analysis. (1) Loyalty card data could, for instance, provide information about what individuals or families have been consuming in their diet.\n\n*   Traditionally, dietary intake information is gathered by self-reporting. Yet, evidence suggests that this self-reporting approach is inaccurate, with biases towards perceived norms.\n\n*   Funding models for Data Trusts widely vary and sustainability for each model has not been explored long-term.\n\n*   Security and archival models for storage have not yet been standardized (although many frameworks are in development)(4-5)\n\n*   Data can still potentially be used to harm, stigmatize, or create purposeful miscalculations by malicious agents.\n\n<br /><br />**Notes**\n\n1.

      - title: Data Trusts & Ethical E-Commerce
        description: >
          The current environment of e-commerce is more connected and interwoven
          than ever with software, apps, mobile/wearable devices, and sites that
          track your every movement and action online. The benefit to consumers
          is more relevant data processed and delivered to them via ads
          hyper-personalized to their current wants and location, the ability to
          see where you are and where you've been, medical portals tracking
          health, purchasing habits, etc. As the scope and speed of data are
          cross-referenced, a customer becomes an encyclopedic data point with
          vast amounts of specific personal and private information that can be
          damaging if leaked or used by unscrupulous companies to drive profits
          through the sale of that data. This leads to a trust deficiency in
          consumer minds of businesses on the web in general, creating a more
          significant barrier to gaining a more reputable reputation.<br /><br
          /> Using a Data Trust allows the e-commerce business to access, store,
          and evaluate data on current customers, potential customers, and
          trends while simultaneously keeping that data safe and manageable by
          the customer via the trust's legal structure and access rules.
          Building trust in e-commerce is no different than trust between two
          people. Trust is inherently hard to gain and easy to lose. In
          e-commerce, trust is a primary driver of why a consumer may buy from
          your store versus a competitor (Laudon & Traver 2018) company with a
          higher reputation is a company that can more easily charge higher
          prices, lower the risk of newer products, and even create consumer
          evangelists.<br /><br /> An example of how powerful trust can be is
          Apple's reputation in the eyes of consumers. "Apple has a powerful
          brand and unrivaled track record when it comes to the user's
          experience – in particular, it has taken a strong stance on privacy.
          Last month its iPhone advert said 'We believe your privacy should
          never be something you have to question'" (Mavadiya 2019). But even
          one of the most trusted companies on the planet is subject to the
          fragility of the trust factor. When Apple announced, they were rolling
          out iPhone photo data scraping for images of child sexual abuse. This
          announcement was met with immediate backlash as even though the
          intentions were good, it felt like a betrayal of the core value of
          privacy Apple has maintained (Associated Press 2021).<br /><br /> Our
          first step as an e-commerce company is to begin to foster trust
          through the use of a Data Trust. This step is one of many on the long
          road to becoming a company known for being ethical and honest with the
          data we're given.
      - title: 'How Büt Camp, Inc. Employs Data Trusts'
        description: >
          Büt Camp. Inc. (BCI), an e-commerce certified B-Corp, selling
          single-person temporary shelter directly to emergency responders,
          local disaster preparedness groups and councils, survival preppers,
          and day hikers, has an ethical duty to store data that does not treat
          the customer's privacy as a source of income. We employ Data Trusts
          for our benefit and the benefit of the consumers and potential
          customers.<br /><br />


          In terms of research data, similar to AI research, and sharing data
          responsibly, Büt Camp Inc.'s product is built on an innovative,
          patented PLA technology. We feel that sharing this data with others in
          a Data Trust and those our Data Trust approves, rather than with
          anyone who may reappropriate it, is optimal for continuing research in
          PLA technology and ethical data sharing.<br /><br />


          **Data Büt Camp, Inc. Collects**<br /><br />


          Customers order from Büt Camp, Inc.’s online store via the web or
          progressive web application (PWA). The order process requires a
          certain amount of data from the customer to allow BCI to process and
          deliver the order. Data entered, gathered, and generated includes but
          is not necessarily limited to:


            *   Full name


            *   Company if applicable


            *   Address


            *   Credit card


            *   Email address


            *   Phone number


            *   SKUs purchased and quantities


            *   Time of purchase


            *   Shipping Preference


            *   Unique order number


            *   Contact preferences


            *   Length of time on BCI site


            *   Number of visits to BCI site


            *   SKUs placed in cart or removed


            *   Recent purchases


            *   Discounts used<br /><br />


          **Maintaining Our Mission**<br /><br />


          Data is stored only in the Data Trust. Only relevant data needed for
          purchase completion, BCI marketing campaigns, lead generation,
          customer feedback, etc., is requested and given, adhering to the
          trust's strict governance rules. Logs keep records of all transactions
          involving the data to analyze for misuse or data manipulation.<br
          /><br />


          The data held by the trust is not only used by Büt Camp, Inc. but is
          also available to researchers of biodegradable cornstarch-based
          polylactic acid (PLA), other companies, public sector agencies, and
          the customers themselves. The customers can see at any time the data
          collected by Büt Camp, Inc. and what it is used for and why it may be
          accessed, and by whom. A BCI customer has the right to disallow any
          information they wish not to be accessed, as long as it does not
          interfere with the process of completing a purchase. After purchase,
          the customer can elect to destroy all relevant data or anonymize it
          for later use, stripping any personal data that could be traced back
          to that individual or entity.<br /><br />


          This level of conditional and ethical data governance is best suited
          for use in a data trust. With a third party trust guiding and
          maintaining the data and access to it while also explaining the use
          patterns, customers and Büt Camp, Inc. can be assured that any
          customer and BCI data is safe and helpful to the community overall.
          Ethical data practice is a guiding principle of BCI to be a steward to
          people and the environment.
