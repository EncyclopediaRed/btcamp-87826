          **Modern Data Governance Needs**


          Have you ever wondered what really happens with the data you provide
          your online services and accounts? Of course you have! Using Google,
          Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and any other e-commerce or social media
          service not only allows them to keep your data, but use it to generate
          product recommendations and targeted ads.<br /><br />

          The individual user has little autonomy over what happens to their
          data they knowingly or unknowingly provide online services and
          websites. There are specific laws for protecting User Data, but in the
          US they are only just being introduced in Congress (for example, see
          H.R.4240 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): User Data Protection Act.
          (2021, June 29).
          <https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4240).><br
          /><br />

          General Data Protection Regulation¹ do exist, as well as the Personal
          Data Protection Bill, however, current data rights are often exchanged
          from the company and its consumers through Privacy Policies, User
          Agreements, and/or Terms of Condition, which are challenging and
          lengthy to read and difficult to combat if they are read and
          disagreeable to the user. Teresa Scassa, the Canada Research Chair in
          Information Law and Policy at the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of
          Law, sums it up perfectly: “There is simply too much to manage, and
          often the way it is presented to consumers makes it difficult for them
          to make informed choices. In this context, clicking “I agree” without
          reading privacy policies is an act of surrender, not of consent.”³<br
          /><br />

          We hear you, Teresa.<br /><br />

          Recently there have been calls for companies to answer for how they
          manage user data and what they use it for, an example being the recent
          2020 inquiry into multiple e-commerce and social media companies
          including Amazon, TikTok, Twitter, and others,⁴ as well as multiple
          discussions on ethical data use in many other applications,⁴ including
          other tech companies like Uber, Google Maps, and Facebook⁵<br /><br />

          We believe that businesses should have clear, transparent standards on
          how they will use customer data that is human-readable.<br /><br />

          Büt Camp Inc. wants a solution that allows our customer data to
          benefit the company, researchers, and other companies through ethical
          data sharing.

          ## Data Trusts


          **A Data Trust is a legal framework for managing data.**


          What that really means is that there is a group of beneficiaries that
          produce data who enter a legal contract based on trust law with
          trustees who follow the contract and facilitate the appropriate
          handling of the data. This means that beneficiaries have complete
          control and understanding of how their data is being used and why. 


          There are 3 primary concepts involved in a data trust:


          1.  There is a clear intention to establish a trust


          2.  The subject matter or property of the Trust is defined


          3.  The beneficiaries of the Trust are specified (including as a
          conceptual category rather than nominally)


          Data Trusts are used in several fields, including social media,
          hospitals and other health data repositories, research data,
          artificial intelligence research and data, and, you guessed it,
          e-commerce. 



          Key Entities for data trusts include the following:


          *   **Beneficiaries**: Data producers (customers, individuals,
          companies, organizations, society)


          *   **Trustees**: Those entrusted with monitoring compliance and
          gatekeeping of data based on agreed-upon terms with the beneficiaries


          *   **Trust** **Law**: “Trust law refers to laws governing the
          creation and implementation of trusts, which are fiduciary
          relationships. In this type of relationship, one party (called the
          trustor) gives a second party (called the trustee) the right to hold
          title to assets or property for the benefit of a third party (called
          the beneficiary).”


          *   **Data Rights**: The right for individuals to know what is
          happening with their data without having to read intentionally
          confusing and lengthy agreements


          *   **Technology**: Validation, storage, and security measures applied
          to data with access limited to the Trustees


          *   **Funding Models**: Ranging from funded, unfunded, endowment,
          subscription, etc.


          *   **Shared Data Goals**: Understanding of and agreement of
          beneficiaries on how data is shared, to whom it is shared, why it is
          shared, and compliance with these parameters


          Below is a lifecycle for how a data trust works with BütCamp, Inc.
          built into the model. Essentially, we provide a clear, concise
          statement to all users describing their data rights before they enter
          any personal information. We keep only the data necessary to complete
          an order successfully, and data is put into a data trust that BütCamp
          uses for ethical research.
