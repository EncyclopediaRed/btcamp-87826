          **Modern Data Governance Needs**


          Have you ever wondered what really happens with the data you provide
          your online services and accounts? Of course you have! Using Google,
          Amazon, Twitter, Facebook, and any other e-commerce or social media
          service not only allows them to keep your data, but use it to generate
          product recommendations and targeted ads.<br /><br />

          The individual user has little autonomy over what happens to their
          data they knowingly or unknowingly provide online services and
          websites. There are specific laws for protecting User Data, but in the
          US they are only just being introduced in Congress (for example, see
          H.R.4240 - 117th Congress (2021-2022): User Data Protection Act.
          (2021, June 29).
          <https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/4240).><br
          /><br />

          General Data Protection Regulation¹ do exist, as well as the Personal
          Data Protection Bill, however, current data rights are often exchanged
          from the company and its consumers through Privacy Policies, User
          Agreements, and/or Terms of Condition, which are challenging and
          lengthy to read and difficult to combat if they are read and
          disagreeable to the user. Teresa Scassa, the Canada Research Chair in
          Information Law and Policy at the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of
          Law, sums it up perfectly: “There is simply too much to manage, and
          often the way it is presented to consumers makes it difficult for them
          to make informed choices. In this context, clicking “I agree” without
          reading privacy policies is an act of surrender, not of consent.”³<br
          /><br />

          We hear you, Teresa.<br /><br />

          Recently there have been calls for companies to answer for how they
          manage user data and what they use it for, an example being the recent
          2020 inquiry into multiple e-commerce and social media companies
          including Amazon, TikTok, Twitter, and others,⁴ as well as multiple
          discussions on ethical data use in many other applications,⁴ including
          other tech companies like Uber, Google Maps, and Facebook⁵<br /><br />

          We believe that businesses should have clear, transparent standards on
          how they will use customer data that is human-readable.<br /><br />

          Büt Camp Inc. wants a solution that allows our customer data to
          benefit the company, researchers, and other companies through ethical
          data sharing.

          ## Data Trusts


          **A Data Trust is a legal framework for managing data.**


          What that really means is that there is a group of beneficiaries that
          produce data who enter a legal contract based on trust law with
          trustees who follow the contract and facilitate the appropriate
          handling of the data. This means that beneficiaries have complete
          control and understanding of how their data is being used and why. 


          There are 3 primary concepts involved in a data trust:


          1.  There is a clear intention to establish a trust


          2.  The subject matter or property of the Trust is defined


          3.  The beneficiaries of the Trust are specified (including as a
          conceptual category rather than nominally)


          Data Trusts are used in several fields, including social media,
          hospitals and other health data repositories, research data,
          artificial intelligence research and data, and, you guessed it,
          e-commerce. 



          Key Entities for data trusts include the following:


          *   **Beneficiaries**: Data producers (customers, individuals,
          companies, organizations, society)


          *   **Trustees**: Those entrusted with monitoring compliance and
          gatekeeping of data based on agreed-upon terms with the beneficiaries


          *   **Trust** **Law**: “Trust law refers to laws governing the
          creation and implementation of trusts, which are fiduciary
          relationships. In this type of relationship, one party (called the
          trustor) gives a second party (called the trustee) the right to hold
          title to assets or property for the benefit of a third party (called
          the beneficiary).”


          *   **Data Rights**: The right for individuals to know what is
          happening with their data without having to read intentionally
          confusing and lengthy agreements


          *   **Technology**: Validation, storage, and security measures applied
          to data with access limited to the Trustees


          *   **Funding Models**: Ranging from funded, unfunded, endowment,
          subscription, etc.


          *   **Shared Data Goals**: Understanding of and agreement of
          beneficiaries on how data is shared, to whom it is shared, why it is
          shared, and compliance with these parameters


          Below is a lifecycle for how a data trust works with BütCamp, Inc.
          built into the model. Essentially, we provide a clear, concise
          statement to all users describing their data rights before they enter
          any personal information. We keep only the data necessary to complete
          an order successfully, and data is put into a data trust that BütCamp
          uses for ethical research.

      - title: Data Trusts & Ethical E-Commerce
        description: "The current environment of e-commerce is more connected and interwoven than ever with software, apps, mobile/wearable devices, and sites that track your every movement and action online. The benefit to consumers is more relevant data processed and delivered to them via ads hyper-personalized to their current wants and location, the ability to see where you are and where you've been, medical portals tracking health, purchasing habits, etc. As the scope and speed of data are cross-referenced, a customer becomes an encyclopedic data point with vast amounts of specific personal and private information that can be damaging if leaked or used by unscrupulous companies to drive profits through the sale of that data. This leads to a trust deficiency in consumer minds of businesses on the web in general, creating a more significant barrier to gaining a more reputable reputation.\n\n\nUsing a Data Trust allows the e-commerce business to access, store, and evaluate data on current customers, potential customers, and trends while simultaneously keeping that data safe and manageable by the customer via the trust's legal structure and access rules. Building trust in e-commerce is no different than trust between two people. Trust is inherently hard to gain and easy to lose. In e-commerce, trust is a primary driver of why a consumer may buy from your store versus a competitor.1 A company with a higher reputation is a company that can more easily charge higher prices, lower the risk of newer products, and even create consumer evangelists.\_\n\nAn example of how powerful trust can be is Apple's reputation in the eyes of consumers. \"Apple has a powerful brand and unrivaled track record when it comes to the user's experience – in particular, it has taken a strong stance on privacy. Last month its iPhone advert said 'We believe your privacy should never be something you have to question.'\"2 But even one of the most trusted companies on the planet is subject to the fragility of the trust factor. When Apple announced, they were rolling out iPhone photo data scraping for images of child sexual abuse. This announcement was met with immediate backlash as even though the intentions were good, it felt like a betrayal of the core value of privacy Apple has maintained.3\n\nOur first step as an e-commerce company is to begin to foster trust through the use of a Data Trust. This step is one of many on the long road to becoming a company known for being ethical and honest with the data we're given.\n"
      - title: 'How BütCamp, Inc. Employs Data Trusts'
        description: >
          Büt Camp. Inc. (BCI), an e-commerce certified B-Corp, selling
          single-person temporary shelter directly to emergency responders,
          local disaster preparedness groups and councils, survival preppers,
          and day hikers, has an ethical duty to store data that does not treat
          the customer's privacy as a source of income. We employ Data Trusts
          for our benefit and the benefit of the consumers and potential
          customers.


          In terms of research data, similar to AI research, and sharing data
          responsibly, Büt Camp Inc.'s product is built on an innovative,
          patented PLA technology. We feel that sharing this data with others in
          a Data Trust and those our Data Trust approves, rather than with
          anyone who may reappropriate it, is optimal for continuing research in
          PLA technology and ethical data sharing.


          **Data BütCamp, Inc. Collects**


          Customers order from Büt Camp, Inc.’s online store via the web or
          progressive web application (PWA). The order process requires a
          certain amount of data from the customer to allow BCI to process and
          deliver the order. Data entered, gathered, and generated includes but
          is not necessarily limited to:


          *   Full name


          *   Company if applicable


          *   Address


          *   Credit card


          *   Email address


          *   Phone number


          *   SKUs purchased and quantities


          *   Time of purchase


          *   Shipping Preference


          *   Unique order number


          *   Contact preferences


          *   Length of time on BCI site


          *   Number of visits to BCI site


          *   SKUs placed in cart or removed


          *   Recent purchases


          *   Discounts used


          **Maintaining Our Mission**


          Data is stored only in the Data Trust. Only relevant data needed for
          purchase completion, BCI marketing campaigns, lead generation,
          customer feedback, etc., is requested and given, adhering to the
          trust's strict governance rules. Logs keep records of all transactions
          involving the data to analyze for misuse or data manipulation.


          The data held by the trust is not only used by Büt Camp, Inc. but is
          also available to researchers of biodegradable cornstarch-based
          polylactic acid (PLA), other companies, public sector agencies, and
          the customers themselves. The customers can see at any time the data
          collected by Büt Camp, Inc. and what it is used for and why it may be
          accessed, and by whom. A BCI customer has the right to disallow any
          information they wish not to be accessed, as long as it does not
          interfere with the process of completing a purchase. After purchase,
          the customer can elect to destroy all relevant data or anonymize it
          for later use, stripping any personal data that could be traced back
          to that individual or entity.


          This level of conditional and ethical data governance is best suited
          for use in a data trust. With a third party trust guiding and
          maintaining the data and access to it while also explaining the use
          patterns, customers and Büt Camp, Inc. can be assured that any
          customer and BCI data is safe and helpful to the community overall.
          Ethical data practice is a guiding principle of BCI to be a steward to
          people and the environment.
