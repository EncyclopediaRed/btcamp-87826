      **Mission**<br />
      Büt Camp, Inc. strives to help provide shelter and privacy to
      those in any emergency using simple, easily dispensed, highly mobile,
      inflatable cornstarch-based tents stored in a waist bag (fanny pack) or a
      similar small vessel. <br /><br />

      **Vision** <br />
      We envision the Büt Camp biodegradable cornstarch-based
      polylactic acid (PLA)¹ shelters being available in every first responder,
      search and rescue, Red Cross, and emergency preppers arsenal for helping
      to treat those in need of immediate protection from the elements.

    headline: Our Goal
    subtitle: >-
      Out of the prototype stage, with several patents pending, our end goal is
      to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous with a small comfort during a
      stressful time. We are pushing to move from a local market into larger
      regional areas within the following year.<br /><br />

      We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into a
      national offering. Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D printed
      camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools, and first aid
      kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D schematics via
      direct-to-consumer sales.
