      # **Mission**

      Büt Camp, Inc. strives to help provide shelter and privacy to those in any
      emergency using simple, easily dispensed, highly mobile, inflatable
      cornstarch-based tents stored in a waist bag (fanny pack) or a similar
      small vessel. &#xA; <br /><br /> 
      
      **Vision** <br /><br />

      We envision the Büt Camp biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid
      (PLA)¹ shelters being available in every first responder, search and
      rescue, Red Cross, and emergency preppers arsenal for helping to treat
      those in need of immediate protection from the elements.

    headline: Our Goal
    subtitle: >-
      Out of the prototype stage, with several patents pending, our end goal is
      to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous with a small comfort during a
      stressful time. We are pushing to move from a local market into larger
      regional areas within the following year.<br /><br />

      We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into a
      national offering. Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D printed
      camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools, and first aid
      kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D schematics via
      direct-to-consumer sales.

        description: >
          Website: <https://compostbagchina.com><br /><br />  Location: Shandong
          Province, China<br /><br />

          Compost Bag China (CBC) is our manufacturer and expert in PLA film.<br
          /><br />

          CBC creates several sheets of PLA film. The top of which is two sheets
          heat-stamped together in a pattern to create an air channel to allow
          for inflation of the tent.<br /><br />

          A screen and floor are also produced with the same material. The floor
          is heat-sealed to the top portion of the tent, and the screen is kept
          separate until the customer constructs the field. The screen adheres
          to the tent's opening via a mild tacky glue strip on one side of the
          opening and two ties on the other side. The ties are strips of PLA
          hardened to allow for tying and untying.<br /><br />

          CBC requires payment upfront for order volumes of our size. And
          delivery is made after inspection via shipping container. Due to
          COVID-19, customs has been slower to receive shipments, but we don’t
          foresee significant delays in time to receipt, except in the months of
          January/February during the Chinese Lunar New Year.
