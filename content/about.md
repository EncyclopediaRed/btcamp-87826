      #### **Mission** 

      Büt Camp, Inc. strives to help provide shelter and privacy to those in any
      emergency using simple, easily dispensed, highly mobile, inflatable
      cornstarch-based tents stored in a waist bag (fanny pack) or a similar
      small vessel. &#xA; <br /><br /> **Vision**  

      We envision the Büt Camp biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid
      (PLA)¹ shelters being available in every first responder, search and
      rescue, Red Cross, and emergency preppers arsenal for helping to treat
      those in need of immediate protection from the elements.

    headline: Our Goal
    subtitle: >-
      Out of the prototype stage, with several patents pending, our end goal is
      to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous with a small comfort during a
      stressful time. We are pushing to move from a local market into larger
      regional areas within the following year.<br /><br />

      We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into a
      national offering. Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D printed
      camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools, and first aid
      kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D schematics via
      direct-to-consumer sales.

          And here's Quan! Quan is an enigma. He questions all things equally.
          Seemingly knowledgeable in the answers yet not sharing, Quan also
          enjoys cats, but not as much as his daughter.
