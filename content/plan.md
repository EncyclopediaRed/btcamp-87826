      - title: The Problem
        description: "Affordable, easily distributed emergency shelters are often in short supply during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or hiking incident. There has been an increase in the need for disaster-planning products, including personal temporary shelters, to ensure a timely response to an event.1\n\n\n\nDisasters also have a significant impact on the environment2 that furthers the damage of the actual event and the subsequent waste. Plastics and inorganic materials are the primary material used in emergency materials for their lightweight feature but further increase the long-term impact of disasters and personal incidents.\n\n\n\n> “Increasing incidents of natural and anthropogenic hazards globally have led to a rise in the procurement of necessary equipment and response vehicles by the concerned government agencies.\_\n>\n\n> There are many incidents in recent times where inadequacy of equipment has caused delays in mitigating the damages. Learning from the past, many countries have increased the necessary disaster response equipment at disposal.”\n\n> *--\_ Mordor Intelligence on the Emergency Disaster and Response Market*\n"

        description: >
          Made from biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid (PLA), Büt
          Camp offers a simple-to-use single-person temporary shelter to provide
          small comfort during stressful situations. Products are designed to be
          highly visible and come in red, orange, and bright green and to
          decrease waste caused by emergency and disaster situations.


          Manually inflatable channels take little time to inflate and provide a
          structural canopy to create a small personal tent with an additional
          add-on screen attached with biodegradable adhesive tape and PLA fiber
          string ties.


          Büt Camp is unique because it is an inexpensive and biodegradable
          option for temporary shelter and is perfect for emergency planning and
          response. With multiple patents pending, Büt Camp is designed and
          produced sustainably and responsibly.


          Research into the cost of PLA indicated an affordable $0.15/gram, and
          at five (5) yards per tent, production costs are low enough to produce
          in bulk.3


          **Total Tent COGS: $8.50/unit**
