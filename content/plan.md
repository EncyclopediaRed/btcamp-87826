      - title: The Problem
        description: Affordable, easily distributed emergency shelters are often in short supply during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or hiking incident. There has been an increase in the need for disaster-planning products, including personal temporary shelters, to ensure a timely response to an event.1 Disasters also have a significant impact on the environment2 that furthers the damage of the actual event and the subsequent waste. Plastics and inorganic materials are the primary material used in emergency materials for their lightweight feature but further increase the long-term impact of disasters and personal incidents.
         “Increasing incidents of natural and anthropogenic hazards globally have led to a rise in the procurement of necessary equipment and response vehicles by the concerned government agencies.\_There are many incidents in recent times where inadequacy of equipment has caused delays in mitigating the damages. Learning from the past, many countries have increased the necessary disaster response equipment at disposal.”<br />\--\_ Mordor Intelligence on the Emergency Disaster and Response Market\n"
