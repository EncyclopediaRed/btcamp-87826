      - title: 'The Problem: Disaster Preparedness Needs'
        description: >-
          Affordable, easily distributed emergency shelters are often in short
          supply during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or hiking
          incident. There has been an increase in the need for disaster-planning
          products, including personal temporary shelters, to ensure a timely
          response to an event (1). Disasters also have a significant impact on the
          environment(2) that furthers the damage of the actual event and the
          subsequent waste. Plastics and inorganic materials are the primary
          material used in emergency materials for their lightweight feature but
          further increase the long-term impact of disasters and personal
          incidents.<br /><br />
          “Increasing incidents of natural and
          anthropogenic hazards globally have led to a rise in the procurement
          of necessary equipment and response vehicles by the concerned
          government agencies. There are many incidents in recent times where
          inadequacy of equipment has caused delays in mitigating the damages.
          Learning from the past, many countries have increased the necessary
          disaster response equipment at disposal.”<br /> --Mordor Intelligence
          on the Emergency Disaster and Response Market"
      - title: 'The Solution: BütCamp'
        description: >
          Made from biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid (PLA), Büt
          Camp offers a simple-to-use single-person temporary shelter to provide
          small comfort during stressful situations. Products are designed to be
          highly visible and come in red, orange, and bright green and to
          decrease waste caused by emergency and disaster situations.<br /><br
          />


          Manually inflatable channels take little time to inflate and provide a
          structural canopy to create a small personal tent with an additional
          add-on screen attached with biodegradable adhesive tape and PLA fiber
          string ties.<br /><br />


          Büt Camp is unique because it is an inexpensive and biodegradable
          option for temporary shelter and is perfect for emergency planning and
          response. With multiple patents pending, Büt Camp is designed and
          produced sustainably and responsibly.<br /><br />


          Research into the cost of PLA indicated an affordable $0.15/gram, and
          at five (5) yards per tent, production costs are low enough to produce
          in bulk (3).<br /><br />


          **Total Tent COGS: $8.50/unit**

          # Target Customer<br /><br />


          Büt Camp itself is designed to be easily usable by anyone in need of a
          temporary shelter. The target audience varies from adult individuals
          wishing to have a contingency shelter plan, individuals whose
          occupations require additional emergency response equipment, and
          larger groups that plan for and implement disaster recovery
          responses.<br /><br />

          # Competitors<br /><br />


          ## Emergency and Disaster Response<br /><br />


          Companies selling disaster recovery and emergency preparedness
          products are primary competitors for Büt Camp. These companies
          specialize in products built for emergency response, including the
          niche of shelter and temporary shelter. Large organizations like EMT
          Safety (1) and Ali Med (2) provide a range of response kits and materials
          from emergency shelters, first aid, and rescue equipment. Companies
          like Inhabitat3 (Image 1) and Grainger (4) (Image 2) provide emergency
          shelters. Examples are shown in Image 1 and Image 2, designed
          explicitly for disasters and emergencies. Covid-19 has revealed that
          there are significant gaps in emergency response planning (5). As shown
          in Figure 1, the Emergency and Disaster Response market shows a slight
          increase over the next four (4) years as disaster planning groups at
          local, regional, national, and global levels continue to improve and
          increase preparation measures.<br /><br />

          ![](/images/grainger.png)<br /><br />


          ## Camping Equipment<br /><br />


          Companies selling camping equipment are another primary competitor for
          Büt Camp Inc. Büt Camp is categorized as a tent and therefore as
          camping equipment. Although we are not competing with companies
          selling traditional camping equipment, we compete with specific
          products and uses.<br /><br />

          For example, REI SOL Thermal Bivy (Image 3) provides a method to limit
          exposure to the elements and is reasonably portable. Additionally,
          products like the Sneaker Shelter prototype (Image 4) is a floorless,
          single-person, portable shelter that zips together and worn on shoes
          that come with the product.<br /><br />

      - title: Operations
        description: "**Production**<br /><br />Compost Bag China (CBC) is our manufacturer and expert in PLA film.\n\nCBC creates several sheets of PLA film. The top of which is two sheets heat-stamped together in a pattern to create an air channel to allow for inflation of the tent. <br /><br />Ascreen and floor are also produced with the same material. The floor is heat-sealed to the top portion of the tent, and the screen is kept separate until the customer constructs it in the field. The screen adheres to the tent's opening via a mild tacky glue strip on one side of the opening and two ties on the other side. The ties are strips of PLA hardened to allow for tying and untying.<br /><br />
        The cost per tent to manufacture is $8.50/unit.<br /><br />
        ## **Quality Control**<br /><br /> <br /><br />
        QC is performed by our Chinese liaison ODM Group as part of our contract with them.\n\nODM works directly with the manufacturer to hold to ISO Standards1 and ASTM Standards2 for durability, functionality as a tent, and biodegradability of the PLA film and finished product.\n\nODM Group is our direct contact for:\_\n\n*   Representative office in Zhuhai\n\n*   Product sourcing\n\n*   QC reporting ## **Inventory**<br /><br /> No raw materials are kept on hand. All material is sourced through ODM Group and sent directly to the manufacturer in China, Compost Bag China.\n\n$85,000 (10,000 units) are kept on hand in a rented storage facility.\n\nWe keep roughly two (2) months of inventory on hand.\n\nThough there is no seasonal activity at the moment, we anticipate future seasonal bumps in sales during:\n\n*   Hurricane season on the East Coast of the U.S\n\n*   June 1 - November 303\n\n*   Fire season in California\n\n*   June-April (2 Seasons overlapping)4<br /><br />

        CBC requires payment upfront for order volumes of our size, and delivery is made after inspection via shipping container.<br /><br /> Due to COVID-19, customs has been slower to receive shipments, but we don’t foresee significant delays in time to receipt, except in the months of January/February during the Chinese Lunar New Year. <br /><br />

      - title: Positioning & Niche
        description: >
          Büt Camp has a unique position in the market as a currently unrealized
          product for temporary, portable, biodegradable, emergency shelters. We
          provide an entirely different product from our primary competitors
          because we want to supplement disaster and survival planning, not
          replace products in the current market.<br /><br />



          We also strive for sustainable methods in production and use a
          material that is firmly becoming a viable option for replacing
          traditional fabrics with a biodegradable material in temporary use
          cases. Our target markets already exist, and the projection for those
          markets previously discussed shows an evident growth and desire from
          consumers for products.<br /><br />


          **Supplementary: Not a Replacement**<br /><br />



          Büt Camp supplements disaster response and contingency planning and is
          not a replacement for more robust shelter. The nature of PLAs and it’s
          exposure to the environment for prolonged periods makes the Büt Camp
          emergency tent a 1-2 day maximum emergency shelter.<br /><br />


          Büt Camp allows diversification of individual contingency planning and
          an option for fast and easily distributed emergency shelters on a
          large scale.
