      - title: The Problem
        description: >-
          Affordable, easily distributed emergency shelters are often in short
          supply during an emergency, such as a natural disaster or hiking
          incident. There has been an increase in the need for disaster-planning
          products, including personal temporary shelters, to ensure a timely
          response to an event.1 Disasters also have a significant impact on the
          environment2 that furthers the damage of the actual event and the
          subsequent waste. Plastics and inorganic materials are the primary
          material used in emergency materials for their lightweight feature but
          further increase the long-term impact of disasters and personal
          incidents. “Increasing incidents of natural and anthropogenic hazards
          globally have led to a rise in the procurement of necessary equipment
          and response vehicles by the concerned government agencies.\_There are
          many incidents in recent times where inadequacy of equipment has
          caused delays in mitigating the damages. Learning from the past, many
          countries have increased the necessary disaster response equipment at
          disposal.”<br />\--\_ Mordor Intelligence on the Emergency Disaster
          and Response Market\n"

        description: >
          Made from biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid (PLA), Büt
          Camp offers a simple-to-use single-person temporary shelter to provide
          small comfort during stressful situations. Products are designed to be
          highly visible and come in red, orange, and bright green and to
          decrease waste caused by emergency and disaster situations.<br /><br
          />


          Manually inflatable channels take little time to inflate and provide a
          structural canopy to create a small personal tent with an additional
          add-on screen attached with biodegradable adhesive tape and PLA fiber
          string ties.<br /><br />


          Büt Camp is unique because it is an inexpensive and biodegradable
          option for temporary shelter and is perfect for emergency planning and
          response. With multiple patents pending, Büt Camp is designed and
          produced sustainably and responsibly.<br /><br />


          Research into the cost of PLA indicated an affordable $0.15/gram, and
          at five (5) yards per tent, production costs are low enough to produce
          in bulk.3


          **Total Tent COGS: $8.50/unit**

          # Target Customer<br /><br />


          Büt Camp itself is designed to be easily usable by anyone in need of a
          temporary shelter. The target audience varies from adult individuals
          wishing to have a contingency shelter plan, individuals whose
          occupations require additional emergency response equipment, and
          larger groups that plan for and implement disaster recovery responses.

          # Competitors<br /><br />


          ## Emergency and Disaster Response


          Companies selling disaster recovery and emergency preparedness
          products are primary competitors for Büt Camp. These companies
          specialize in products built for emergency response, including the
          niche of shelter and temporary shelter. Large organizations like EMT
          Safety1 and Ali Med2 provide a range of response kits and materials
          from emergency shelters, first aid, and rescue equipment. Companies
          like Inhabitat3 (Image 1) and Grainger4 (Image 2) provide emergency
          shelters. Examples are shown in Image 1 and Image 2, designed
          explicitly for disasters and emergencies. Covid-19 has revealed that
          there are significant gaps in emergency response planning.5 As shown
          in Figure 1, the Emergency and Disaster Response market shows a slight
          increase over the next four (4) years as disaster planning groups at
          local, regional, national, and global levels continue to improve and
          increase preparation measures.

          ## Camping Equipment


          Companies selling camping equipment are another primary competitor for
          Büt Camp Inc. Büt Camp is categorized as a tent and therefore as
          camping equipment. Although we are not competing with companies
          selling traditional camping equipment, we compete with specific
          products and uses.

          For example, REI SOL Thermal Bivy Image 3 provides a method to limit
          exposure to the elements and is reasonably portable. Additionally,
          products like the Sneaker Shelter prototype Image 4 is a floorless,
          single-person, portable shelter that zips together and worn on shoes
          that come with the product.
