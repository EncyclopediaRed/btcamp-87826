      - title: The BütCamp
        description: >
          Made from biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid (PLA), Büt
          Camp offers a simple-to-use single-person temporary shelter to provide
          small comfort during stressful situations. Products are designed to be
          highly visible and come in red, orange, and bright green and to
          decrease waste caused by emergency and disaster situations.



          Manually inflatable channels take little time to inflate and provide a
          structural canopy to create a small personal tent with an additional
          add-on screen attached with biodegradable adhesive tape and PLA fiber
          string ties.


          Büt Camp is unique because it is an inexpensive and biodegradable
          option for temporary shelter and is perfect for emergency planning and
          response. With multiple patents pending, Büt Camp is designed and
          produced sustainably and responsibly.


          Research into the cost of PLA indicated an affordable $0.15/gram, and
          at five (5) yards per tent, production costs are low enough to produce
          in bulk.3
