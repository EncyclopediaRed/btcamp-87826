      # **Mission**

      Büt Camp, Inc. strives to help provide shelter and privacy to those in any
      emergency using simple, easily dispensed, highly mobile, inflatable
      cornstarch-based tents stored in a waist bag (fanny pack) or a similar
      small vessel. &#xA; <br /><br /> 
      
      **Vision** <br /><br />

      We envision the Büt Camp biodegradable cornstarch-based polylactic acid
      (PLA)¹ shelters being available in every first responder, search and
      rescue, Red Cross, and emergency preppers arsenal for helping to treat
      those in need of immediate protection from the elements.
