    questions:
      - question: What is Polylactic Acid (PLA)?
        answer: "![](images/PLA-lifecycle.png)PLA is different than most thermoplastic polymers in that it is derived from **renewable** resources like corn starch or sugar cane.\_\n\n![](images/PLA-chem.png)\n"
      - question: How is PLA different from other plastics?
        answer: >
          Most plastics are derived from the distillation and polymerization of
          nonrenewable petroleum reserves. Plastics that are derived from
          biomass (e.g., PLA) are known as “bioplastics.¹”

          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first

          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
