    headline: What is PLA?
    subtitle: >
      All right, friends. Let’s do this. This section will cover basic,
      frequently asked questions about polylactic acid (PLA), and why it's
      essential to the future of temporary products.

      - question: What is Polylactic Acid (PLA)?
        answer: >
          PLA is different than most thermoplastic polymers in that it is
          derived from **renewable** resources like corn starch or sugar cane.


          The lifecycle below shows the extraction process and final product, as
          well as how the final product can be recycled too!

      - question: How is PLA different from other plastics?
        answer: >
          Most plastics are derived from the distillation and polymerization of
          nonrenewable petroleum reserves. Plastics that are derived from
          biomass (e.g., PLA) are known as “bioplastics.¹”
      - question: What are the primary features of PLA?
        answer: >
          *   Non-petroleum-based
          plastic

          *   Derived from vegetable products

          *   Naturally degrades when exposed to the environment

          *   Can be produced from pre-existing manufacturing equipment

          *   Lower melting temperature (cannot hold a hot liquid)

          *   High permeability (not for long-term storage)

          *   Non-toxic (and therefore safe for food) <br /><br />

      - question: What is PLA used for (other than awesome tents)?
        answer: >+
          *   3D printing


          *   Biodegradable medical devices (e.g. screws meant to degrade in
          6-12 mos)


          *   Plastic films (e.g. mulch films)


          *   Water bottles


          *   Utensils/cutlery/dishware


          *   Short-term packaging (e.g. tea, cups, fruits and vegetables)

          *   Industrial and civilian cloth (e.g. tents!) <br /><br />
