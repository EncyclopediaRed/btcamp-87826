    headline: What is PLA?
    subtitle: >
      All right, friends. Let’s do this. This section will cover basic,
      frequently asked questions about PLA and why it's essential to the future
      of temporary products.

    questions:
      - question: What is Polylactic Acid (PLA)?
        answer: >
          PLA is different than most thermoplastic polymers in that it is
          derived from **renewable** resources like corn starch or sugar cane.


          The lifecycle below shows the extraction process and final product, as
          well as how the final product can be recycled too!

          disadvantages of the polylactic acid
          (PLA)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/eight-advantages-four-disadvantages-polylactic-acid-pla-yewtree-zhang).”

      - question: How is PLA different from other plastics?
        answer: >
          Most plastics are derived from the distillation and polymerization of
          nonrenewable petroleum reserves. Plastics that are derived from
          biomass (e.g., PLA) are known as “bioplastics.¹”
      - question: What are the primary features of PLA?

          plastic


          *   Derived from vegetable products


          *   Naturally degrades when exposed to the environment


          *   Can be produced from pre-existing manufacturing equipment


          *   Lower melting temperature (cannot hold a hot liquid)


          *   High permeability (not for long-term storage)


          *   Non-toxic (and therefore safe for food) <br /><br />

      - question: What is PLA used for (other than awesome tents)?
        answer: >+
          *   3D printing


          *   Biodegradable medical devices (e.g. screws meant to degrade in
          6-12 mos)


          *   Plastic films (e.g. mulch films)


          *   Water bottles


          *   Utensils/cutlery/dishware


          *   Short-term packaging (e.g. tea, cups, fruits and vegetables)

          *   Industrial and civilian cloth (e.g. tents!) <br /><br />
