    questions:
      - question: What is Polylactic Acid (PLA)?
        answer: >-
          Now that’s a frequent one all right, ain’t it? Your answer to this
          should *manage customer expectations*. Just like [a good checkout
          flow](http://bit.ly/2YCN3iG) should. Tell them the truth:

            - US shipping will take between 3 to 5 business days.
            - International shipping will take between 5 and 10 business days.
            - Mars shipping will be automatically redirected to Elon Musk’s Twitter account.
      - question: How is PLA different from other plastics?
        answer: >-
          It happens. Even the most beautiful of plants will disappoint
          *someone*. Again, tell it like it is:

            - All discounted items sales are final.
            - If you’d like another version of your item, please use the return label. Instructions are printed on its back.
            - If your item is damaged or not functioning correctly, email us at info@planty.com, and we’ll refund you + send you a new one ASAP!

          am I right? Make sure you’re as transparent as possible with your data
          handling process. Or, if you’re using Snipcart, just refer to [our ToS
          and DPA](http://bit.ly/2YJwlyt).
      - question: What is PLA used for (other than awesome tents)?
        answer: >-
          Q: Why is this Planty theme so beautiful? <br /> A: We hired our first
          designer a couple of months ago. <br /><br /> Q: Why did you build a
          theme for Stackbit? <br /> A: We believe in Stackbit’s promise of
          opening up the JAMstack to more developers. Plus, we trust these
          folks. [Read more about Stackbit](http://bit.ly/2YAvGix). <br /><br />
          Q: How many people work at Snipcart? <br /> A: Not a lot! We’re a
          small, bootstrapped team of eight human beings. Michael might be a
          robot, though. <br /><br /> Q: Why is Snipcart based in Québec City?
          <br /> A: Have you been here? It’s beaaautiful! <br /><br /> Q: What’s
          the meaning of life? <br /> A: We’re not quite sure. But building
          useful products with people we love feels meaningful enough.
