    headline: What is PLA?
    subtitle: >
      All right, friends. Let’s do this. This section will cover basic,
      frequently asked questions about PLA and why it's essential to the future
      of temporary products.

    questions:
      - question: What is Polylactic Acid (PLA)?
        answer: "PLA is different than most thermoplastic polymers in that it is derived from **renewable** resources like corn starch or sugar cane.\_\n\n![](images/PLA-lifecycle.png)\n"
      - question: How is PLA different from other plastics?
        answer: >
          Most plastics are derived from the distillation and polymerization of
          nonrenewable petroleum reserves. Plastics that are derived from
          biomass (e.g., PLA) are known as “bioplastics.¹”
      - question: What are the primary features of PLA?

          plastic


          *   Derived from vegetable products 


          *   Naturally degrades when exposed to the environment 


          *   Can be produced from pre-existing manufacturing equipment


          *   Lower melting temperature (cannot hold a hot liquid)


          *   High permeability (not for long-term storage)


          *   Non-toxic (and therefore safe for food)

      - question: What is PLA used for (other than awesome tents)?
        answer: >
          *   3D printing


          *   Biodegradable medical devices (e.g. screws meant to degrade in
          6-12 mos)


          *   Plastic films (e.g. mulch films)


          *   Water bottles


          *   Utensils/cutlery/dishware


          *   Short-term packaging (e.g. tea, cups, fruits and vegetables)


          *   Industrial and civilian cloth (e.g. tents!)
