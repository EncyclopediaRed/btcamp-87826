        description: >
          Büt Camp, Inc. selected Snipcart as their primary shopping cart
          platform. We appreciated that it was merchant agnostic, and could
          interface with the most well known e-commerce merchants out there like
          Braintree, Stripe, PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay and more. The
          merchants themselves all offer easy HTML and Javascript snippets and
          APIs to tie back to their merchant accounts. BCI was concerned about
          vendor lock-in and wanted to make sure our shopping cart experience
          didn't have to change if our credit card processing merchant did.<br
          /><br />

          Snipcart is chiefly a payment gateway. This means Snipcart acts as
          like a point-of-sale terminal. The credit card information entered os
          never stored by Snipcart, and more importantly never stored by Büt
          Camp, Inc. A payment processor, for example Braintree, does store the
          credit card information in a vault. But Braintree like other
          processors are Level 1 PCI compliant.<br /><br />

          Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is not a law.
          Rather, it is a set of industry security standards to ensure any
          company that accepts or processes credit cards does so with the utmost
          security available. As a company that would accept credit cards, BCI
          will also need to be PCI compliant, but likely a Level 4, for those
          merchants have lower processing transactions per year. Because BCI
          will also not be storing card data on their servers, our compliance is
          easily determined each year by a few questions answered and submitted
          to our processor for their records.<br /><br />
