      - question: What is your return policy?
        answer: >
          We’ll accept return requests for items that are unopened, unused, with
          the original tags still intact. The product(s) must be in their
          original packaging, if applicable, in the same condition it was
          received.


          We do not accept opened items.


          If you wish to return your item, we must receive your request within
          **30 days** of the date you received your item.


          Once we receive your returned item, our team will review your request
          and inspect the item. We will send you an email to confirm that we’ve
          received your item and are processing your request. We’ll follow up
          with another email once the request has been processed to let you know
          if your return was approved.


          If approved, the money will be refunded to your original method of
          payment within two weeks. All payment companies are different in the
          amount of time it takes to confirm a payment, so it will likely take a
          minimum of a few days for the refund to show up in your bank
          statement.
      - question: How long will my tent last?
        answer: >
          Unopened, the BütCamp tent will last 5-10 years depending on exposure
          to air and light. Store this item in a cool, dark space.


          Once opened, the BütCamp tent will last approximately 7 days or less.
          You will begin to see degradation around that time, and significant
          degradation after 30 days. This product is designed to be temporary
          and biodegradeable. 
      - question: Is this product harmful to the environment?
        answer: >+
          Absolutely not!




          The material we use is called polylactic acid (PLA) and is 100%
          biodegradeable. See our[ PLA FAQ](/faq) page for more information!
