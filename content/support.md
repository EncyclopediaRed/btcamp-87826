      - question: What is your return policy?
        answer: >
          We’ll accept return requests for items that are unopened, unused, with
          the original tags still intact. The product(s) must be in their
          original packaging, if applicable, in the same condition it was
          received.


          We do not accept opened items.


          If you wish to return your item, we must receive your request within
          **30 days** of the date you received your item.


          Once we receive your returned item, our team will review your request
          and inspect the item. We will send you an email to confirm that we’ve
          received your item and are processing your request. We’ll follow up
          with another email once the request has been processed to let you know
          if your return was approved.


          If approved, the money will be refunded to your original method of
          payment within two weeks. All payment companies are different in the
          amount of time it takes to confirm a payment, so it will likely take a
          minimum of a few days for the refund to show up in your bank
          statement.
      - question: How long will my tent last?
        answer: >
          Unopened, the BütCamp tent will last 5-10 years depending on exposure
          to air and light. Store this item in a cool, dark space.


          Once opened, the BütCamp tent will last approximately 7 days or less.
          You will begin to see degradation around that time, and significant
          degradation after 30 days. This product is designed to be temporary
          and biodegradeable. 
      - question: Is this product harmful to the environment?
        answer: >+
          Absolutely not!

          biodegradeable. See our[ PLA FAQ](/faq) page for more information!

Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.Binding ArbitrationIf the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration.

The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") and, where appropriate, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ("AAA Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules.

The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in  United States, Virginia. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Virginia, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.

To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and ArbitrationThe Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief.
