          ## Made With Polylactic Acid (PLA)


          PLA is a plastic made from biodegradeable cornstarch. This temporary
          shelter will never last in a landfill.

      - title: Easy to Set Up
        description: >
          The Büt Camp Emergency Shelter has no poles or stakes. Instead you
          only need to blow into the air chamber to set up your tent. The air
          channels are stiff enough to keep the tent up right for a couple of
          days. And if you need to move, you simply deflate the tent and roll it
          back into the small bag provided.

          Only 8oz in weight, and the tent fits in the palm of your hand. Our
          tent can be taken anywhere or stored for up to two years in even the
          smallest areas. Take it on a day hike as a "just in case." Or store a
          few in your emergency preparedness bug-out bag. Fire and rescue
          services can keep larger quantities on hand for quick and easy
          emergency shelters in a quickly-changing disaster.

          The Büt Camp system saved my bacon when I followed a bear off the main
          trail and got lost. It took days to find me, and I only packed for day
          hike. I "bearly" made it out. But Büt Camp kept me sheltered until the
          rescue squad found me.
