      - title: Primary Challenges
        description: >
          Limited staff: Büt Camp, Inc. is beginning with a small staff to get
          the business up and running


          Brand recognition: As a new product, Büt Camp will need to build brand
          recognition among an initial customer base and expand out


          Limited purchasing options: Currently Büt Camp is only available for
          purchase with a credit card on our website.
      - title: Büt Advantages
        description: >
          **Affordability: **Büt Camp is marketed to be extremely affordable for
          single units and in bulk. Most shelters are for multiple individuals
          and are over thirty (30) dollars for a single unit of average quality.


          **Eco-friendly: **Büt Camp is made of biodegradable cornstarch-based
          polylactic acid (PLA), an eco-friendly replacement for mylar, nylon,
          and other portable shelter materials. The use of PLA reduces the
          carbon footprint of this product and promotes sustainability.


          **Easy to Use: **Büt Camp is designed to be used by anyone with a
          need. Set up includes unfolding and manually inflating the channels to
          create the structure. No additional rods, tools, or accessories are
          necessary for functionality, unlike a traditional tent.


          **Uniqueness: **Büt Camp is a new take on emergency shelters designed
          to supplement planning, limit environmental impact, and still be
          accessible and affordable.


          **Lightweight: **Büt Camp weighs approximately 8oz and folds into a
          small bundle that fits into the waist pack reducing impeding movement
          and transport. Units are small and light, therefore easy to transport
          and store efficiently.
      - title: Primary Objectives
        description: >
          Out of the prototype stage, with several patents pending, our end goal
          is to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous with a small comfort during a
          stressful time. We are pushing to move from a local market into larger
          regional areas within the following year.



          We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into
          a national offering. Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D
          printed camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools,
          and first aid kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D
          schematics via direct-to-consumer sales.

          **Local Market**


          Enter the local market through local brick-and-mortar camping and
          outdoor stores and advertising to local disaster preparedness groups
          and councils to build brand recognition and product awareness.


          **Sample Distribution**


          Büt Camp Inc. will distribute 5,000 units immediately to first
          responders in New Orleans, LA, and Northern California free of cost to
          test the use within a specific customer base and request feedback
          after two (2) months. We will also distribute an additional 1,000
          units to local EMTs and local disaster preparedness groups and
          councils. 


          **Early Feedback Response**


          Gather feedback directly from this customer base through informal
          interviews and quantified questionnaires. By connecting with specific
          components of our projected customer base, we can attain feedback on
          the product and make any appropriate design or packaging changes
          before releasing the final product for purchase.
