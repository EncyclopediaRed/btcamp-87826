      - title: Primary Challenges
        description: >
          **Limited Staff**: Büt Camp, Inc. is beginning with a small staff to
          get the business up and running<br /><br />


          **Brand Recognition:** As a new product, Büt Camp will need to build
          brand recognition among an initial customer base and expand out.<br
          /><br />


          **Limited Purchasing Options**: Currently Büt Camp is only available
          for purchase with a credit card on our website.<br /><br />


          **Single Primary Product:** BütCamp is offering a single product in
          various package sizes.<br /><br />
      - title: Büt Advantages
        description: >
          **Affordability**: Büt Camp is marketed to be extremely affordable for
          single units and in bulk. Most shelters are for multiple individuals
          and are over thirty (30) dollars for a single unit of average
          quality.<br /><br />


          **Eco-friendly:** Büt Camp is made of biodegradable cornstarch-based
          polylactic acid (PLA), an eco-friendly replacement for mylar, nylon,
          and other portable shelter materials. The use of PLA reduces the
          carbon footprint of this product and promotes sustainability.<br /><br
          />


          **Easy to Use**: Büt Camp is designed to be used by anyone with a
          need. Set up includes unfolding and manually inflating the channels to
          create the structure. No additional rods, tools, or accessories are
          necessary for functionality, unlike a traditional tent.<br /><br />


          **Uniqueness**: Büt Camp is a new take on emergency shelters designed
          to supplement planning, limit environmental impact, and still be
          accessible and affordable.<br /><br />


          **Lightweight**: Büt Camp weighs approximately 8oz and folds into a
          small bundle that fits into the waist pack reducing impeding movement
          and transport. Units are small and light, therefore easy to transport
          and store efficiently.
      - title: Primary Objectives
        description: >
          **Brand Recognition**: Out of the prototype stage, with several
          patents pending, our end goal is to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous
          with a small comfort during a stressful time.<br /><br />


          **Market Increase:** We are pushing to move from a local market into
          larger regional areas within the following year. We plan to grow the
          emergency shelter business through investment into a national
          offering.<br /><br />


          **Product Expansion**: Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D
          printed camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools,
          and first aid kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D
          schematics via direct-to-consumer sales.<br /><br />


          **R\&D:** Research and development in additional uses for polylactic
          acid (PLA) products to increase our eco-friendly product line.<br
          /><br />


          **Sustainability:** Have stable investors and investments to support
          increased product demand, support staff, and additional research and
          distribution of new products.
      - title: 'Year 1: MVP & Local Market'
        description: >+
          **Local Market**


          Büt Camp entered the local market through local brick-and-mortar
          camping and outdoor stores and advertised to local disaster
          preparedness groups and councils to build brand recognition and
          product awareness.<br /><br />


          **MVP Distribution**


          Büt Camp Inc. distributed 5,000 units immediately to first responders
          in New Orleans, LA, and Northern California free of cost to test the
          use within a specific customer base and request feedback after two (2)
          months. We also distributed an additional 1,000 units to local EMTs
          and local disaster preparedness groups and councils.<br /><br />


          **Early Feedback Response**


          Büt Camp, Inc. attained and evaluated feedback directly from this
          customer base through informal interviews and quantified
          questionnaires. By connecting with specific components of our
          projected customer base, we responded to feedback on the product and
          make any appropriate design or packaging changes before releasing the
          final product for purchase.<br /><br />


          **2020 Sales**


          2020 sales rely largely on individual and small-batch sales of the
          product. This indicates that our entrance to the local market is
          developing.<br /><br />


          ![](/images/year1.png)

      - title: 'Year 2: Increase Sustainability'
        description: >
          **Increase staff**


          We plan to increase the staff to 10-15 individuals to increase our
          customer service, advertising, and account management strategies.<br
          /><br />


          **Enter Regional Market**


          In the second year, Büt Camp, Inc. hopes to move from a local market
          into larger regional areas.<br /><br />


          **Investment**


          We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into
          a national offering.<br /><br />


          The owners are looking to secure $250,000 for a 25% stake in the
          business. Funding will help accelerate the marketing of the Büt Camp
          shelter and allow us to place either larger orders from our current
          manufacturer at a lower price point or give us the flexibility to
          search for a cheaper, but comparable in quality, manufacturer.
          Valuation is revenue calculated based on five (5) times sales.<br
          /><br />


          **Increase Distribution Points**


          We plan to enter additional points of distribution outside of our
          website, including through Amazon, camping gear sites, disaster
          preparedness sites; as well as brick-and-mortar chains like Walmart,
          Target, Dick's Sporting Goods, and other similar companies.<br /><br
          />


          **2021 Projection**


          We anticipate an uptick in individual and 5-unit tent sales in 2022
          with a decrease in larger units like 50-unit and 100-unit orders as
          these orders may last a customer longer.<br /><br />

      - title: 'Year 3: Product Expansion'
        description: >
          **Stable Investors**


          We hope to attain investors to support at least 25% of the operating
          costs for Büt Camp, Inc.<br /><br />


          **Product Expansion**


          We hope to expand our product line into 3D printed camping and
          survival products such as utensils, multi-tools, and first aid kit
          supplies<br /><br />


          **3D Patterns**


          In addition to expanding products, we hope to offer 3D schematics of
          these products via direct-to-consumer sales for additional re-use.<br
          /><br />


          **2022 Projection**


          We anticipate an increase in all product lines at year 3 with the
          exception of 1000+ bulk offerings as we further engage with national
          and international organizations.<br /><br />
