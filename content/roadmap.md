      - title: Primary Challenges
        description: >
          Limited staff: Büt Camp, Inc. is beginning with a small staff to get
          the business up and running


          Brand recognition: As a new product, Büt Camp will need to build brand
          recognition among an initial customer base and expand out


          Limited purchasing options: Currently Büt Camp is only available for
          purchase with a credit card on our website.
      - title: Büt Advantages
        description: >
          **Affordability**: Büt Camp is marketed to be extremely affordable for
          single units and in bulk. Most shelters are for multiple individuals
          and are over thirty (30) dollars for a single unit of average quality.


          **Eco-friendly:** Büt Camp is made of biodegradable cornstarch-based
          polylactic acid (PLA), an eco-friendly replacement for mylar, nylon,
          and other portable shelter materials. The use of PLA reduces the
          carbon footprint of this product and promotes sustainability.


          **Easy to Use**: Büt Camp is designed to be used by anyone with a
          need. Set up includes unfolding and manually inflating the channels to
          create the structure. No additional rods, tools, or accessories are
          necessary for functionality, unlike a traditional tent.


          **Uniqueness**: Büt Camp is a new take on emergency shelters designed
          to supplement planning, limit environmental impact, and still be
          accessible and affordable.


          **Lightweight**: Büt Camp weighs approximately 8oz and folds into a
          small bundle that fits into the waist pack reducing impeding movement
          and transport. Units are small and light, therefore easy to transport
          and store efficiently.
      - title: Primary Objectives
        description: >
          Out of the prototype stage, with several patents pending, our end goal
          is to make the Büt Camp tent synonymous with a small comfort during a
          stressful time. We are pushing to move from a local market into larger
          regional areas within the following year.



          We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into
          a national offering. Then we plan to expand our product line into 3D
          printed camping and survival products such as utensils, multi-tools,
          and first aid kit supplies, with an eventual goal of offering 3D
          schematics via direct-to-consumer sales.
      - title: 'Year 1: MVP & Local Market'
        description: >
          **Local Market**


          Büt Camp entered the local market through local brick-and-mortar
          camping and outdoor stores and advertised to local disaster
          preparedness groups and councils to build brand recognition and
          product awareness.


          **MVP Distribution**


          Büt Camp Inc. distributed 5,000 units immediately to first responders
          in New Orleans, LA, and Northern California free of cost to test the
          use within a specific customer base and request feedback after two (2)
          months. We also distributed an additional 1,000 units to local EMTs
          and local disaster preparedness groups and councils.


          **Early Feedback Response**


          Büt Camp, Inc. attained and evaluated feedback directly from this
          customer base through informal interviews and quantified
          questionnaires. By connecting with specific components of our
          projected customer base, we responded to feedback on the product and
          make any appropriate design or packaging changes before releasing the
          final product for purchase.


          ***


          **2020 Sales**


          2020 sales rely largely on individual and small-batch sales of the
          product. This indicates that our entrance to the local market is
          developing.

      - title: 'Year 2: Increase Sustainability'
        description: >
          **Increase staff**


          We plan to increase the staff to 10-15 individuals to increase our
          customer service, advertising, and account management strategies.


          **Enter Regional Market**


          In the second year, Büt Camp, Inc. hopes to move from a local market
          into larger regional areas.


          **Investment**


          We plan to grow the emergency shelter business through investment into
          a national offering.


          The owners are looking to secure $250,000 for a 25% stake in the
          business. Funding will help accelerate the marketing of the Büt Camp
          shelter and allow us to place either larger orders from our current
          manufacturer at a lower price point or give us the flexibility to
          search for a cheaper, but comparable in quality, manufacturer.
          Valuation is revenue calculated based on five (5) times sales.
