      After launching a new website and e-commerce store BCI continues to plan
      for the future. As part of our 5 year build out plan, we hope to bring new
      offerings and tech to our online store. Three of these additions are
      outlined below.

    bulletpoints:
      - title: Progressive Web App (PWA)
        description: >
          A PWA uses "service workers, manifests, and other web-platform
          features in combination with progressive enhancement"1 to achieve an
          app-like experience across multiple platforms including but not
          limited to Mac, Windows, Linux, Android, and iOS devices. PWAs run in
          browsers but use the features above to deliver functions like
          installation on the device, address hardware like the camera or
          speaker and mic, push notifications, and easy updating.2 One of the
          best features is data storage for quick retrieval of data and the
          added benefit of caching that data in case of a loss of network
          signal.3

          Because the PWA can be designed to look like any native app the user
          enjoys a recognizable experience that is as rich as a native app.
      - title: A11y (Accessibility)
        description: >
          A11y is numeronym shorthand for digital accessibility, where the "11"
          represents the number of letters between the first and last letters
          "a" and "y". By creating web code that adheres to the guidelines set
          forth by the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) of the W3C
          web developers can make their content more "accessible to people with
          disabilities" and achieve a A11Y friendly site.4 The A11Y Project is a
          "living example of how to create beautiful, accessible, and inclusive
          digital experiences."5 B端t Camp, Inc. wishes to participate and plans
          to identify deficiencies in their web code base to make their shopping
          experience as inclusive as possible. We hope to complete the work in
          the beginning of 2022 and prior to launching a PWA.
      - title: 3D Polylactic Acid (PLA) Store Front
        description: >
          As a champion of what can be achieved with the eco-friendly PLA
          plastics, B端t Camp, Inc. has plans to expand beyond temporary
          emergency shelters and offer up an expanding array of temporary PLA 3D
          printed goods and services. As PLA filament is easily printed with,
          the nature of PLA makes the durability and heat resistance less than a
          traditional plastic like ABS or PET. But better for the environment.


          First, BCI plans to expand it's storefront by introducing a free
          marketplace for users to share 3D plans that will work with PLA
          filaments. Allowing users to share their designs with others.


          Second, BCI hopes to enter the professionally PLA 3D printed space by
          offering up high quality pre-printed goods on our existing store front
          and selling access to our models for users to try at home.
